Key Features

Flexible Transfer Options: Supports multiple transfer operations:
copy_s3_file_to_sftp: Copies a single file from S3 to the SFTP server.
copy_s3_folder_to_sftp: Copies all files from an S3 folder to the SFTP server.
copy_sftp_folder_to_s3: Copies all files from an SFTP folder to an S3 bucket.
Archiving and Deletion: Automatically archive or delete files from the source after a successful transfer, based on specified parameters.
Customizable Scheduling: Trigger transfers on a custom schedule (e.g., minutes, hours, days) using AWS EventBridge.
Secure Credential Management: Utilizes AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve SFTP credentials.
Modular and Reusable: Designed as a Terraform module, making it easy to integrate into any project needing S3-to-SFTP or SFTP-to-S3 data transfer.
Architecture

This solution leverages several AWS services:

AWS Lambda for serverless file transfer.
Amazon S3 as the cloud storage source/destination.
AWS EventBridge for scheduling.
AWS Secrets Manager for secure management of SFTP credentials.

Pre-Requisites

AWS Account with appropriate permissions to create and manage Lambda, S3, EventBridge, and Secrets Manager resources.
SFTP Server accessible to the AWS environment.
Terraform installed and configured on your local environment.
Module Inputs

Parameter	Type	Default	Description
s3_bucket	string	N/A	The name of the S3 bucket to be used.
s3_prefix	string	""	The S3 path prefix for files or folders.
sftp_path	string	N/A	The destination path on the SFTP server.
operation	string	N/A	Defines the type of file transfer (copy_s3_file_to_sftp, copy_s3_folder_to_sftp, copy_sftp_folder_to_s3).
schedule	object	N/A	Configuration for scheduling, including frequency and interval.
delete_from_source_after_copy	bool	false	If set to true, deletes files from the source after successful transfer.
archive_source_file_after_copy	bool	false	If set to true, archives files in an ARCHIVE folder after successful transfer.
secret_name	string	N/A	The name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret storing SFTP credentials.
Sample Schedule Input
The schedule object allows for customized timing for each transfer operation:

schedule = {
  name     = "databridge_daily"
  metric   = "hour"
  interval = 24
}
Usage

Add Databridge Module to Your Terraform Code
module "databridge" {
  source                     = "path/to/databridge/module"
  s3_bucket                  = "my-s3-bucket"
  s3_prefix                  = "my-data/"
  sftp_path                  = "/remote/data"
  operation                  = "copy_s3_folder_to_sftp"
  delete_from_source_after_copy = true
  archive_source_file_after_copy = true
  secret_name                = "sftp-credentials"
  schedule                   = {
    name     = "databridge_hourly"
    metric   = "hour"
    interval = 1
  }
}
Terraform Initialization and Deployment
Initialize and apply the configuration:

terraform init
terraform apply
Module Outputs

Output	Description
lambda_arn	The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the deployed Lambda function.
eventbridge_rule	The ARN of the EventBridge rule created for scheduling.
Operations and Flow

1. S3-to-SFTP Transfer (Folder)
Triggers based on the schedule defined.
Lists objects in the specified S3 prefix.
For each file, it downloads to Lambda's /tmp directory, then uploads to the SFTP server.
If delete_from_source_after_copy is enabled, files are deleted from S3 after a successful copy.
If archive_source_file_after_copy is enabled, files are moved to an ARCHIVE/ folder.
2. SFTP-to-S3 Transfer
Connects to the SFTP server.
Retrieves files from the specified SFTP path and uploads them to S3.
Optionally archives or deletes files from the SFTP server after transfer.
3. S3-to-SFTP Transfer (Single File)
Similar to folder transfer, but for a single specified file.
Uses the s3_key input to specify the exact file to transfer.
Error Handling and Logging

The Lambda function includes logging for each operation, including:

Connection attempts to SFTP.
File download and upload status.
Success/failure messages for each file transfer.
Archived/deleted file confirmations.
In case of errors, the Lambda function will:

Print detailed error logs for troubleshooting.
Return a False status to indicate a failed transfer.
Advanced Configuration

EventBridge Schedule Customization
You can customize the EventBridge schedule for the Lambda function using the following settings in the schedule parameter:

metric: Frequency of the transfer (minute, hour, day).
interval: Time interval for each transfer.
Secrets Management
This module relies on AWS Secrets Manager for secure credential storage. Ensure that:

The secret is created with a JSON format:
{
  "SFTP_HOST": "example.com",
  "SFTP_USER": "username",
  "SFTP_PASSWORD": "password",
  "SFTP_PORT": "22"
}
IAM permissions are granted to allow Lambda access to the specified secret.
Troubleshooting and FAQs

Common Issues
File Not Found Error
Ensure the correct file path is provided for S3 or SFTP.
Verify permissions for S3 bucket and SFTP directory.
SFTP Connection Dropping
If connections drop during large transfers, try reducing the batch size or increasing the Lambda timeout setting.
Lambda Disk Space Errors
Ensure individual file sizes do not exceed /tmp storage limits (500 MB).
For larger transfers, use streaming solutions or process files in smaller batches.
FAQs
Q: Can I use this module for SFTP-to-SFTP or S3-to-S3 transfers?
A: Currently, Databridge supports only S3-to-SFTP and SFTP-to-S3 transfers.
Q: How can I verify successful file transfers?
A: Use the logs in CloudWatch to monitor each file transferâ€™s status.
Conclusion

Databridge is a robust, configurable solution for managing secure file transfers across AWS S3 and SFTP, designed to support a wide range of data integration needs. Its modular structure, combined with flexible scheduling and reliable archiving/deletion options, makes it ideal for organizations aiming to streamline data exchanges in a secure, automated manner.
